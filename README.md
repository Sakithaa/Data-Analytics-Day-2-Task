# Data Analytics – Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling
Power BI Dashboard : Sales vs Profit Analysis using Superstore dataset


# Objective
Visualize sales and profit data to uncover business insights and highlight loss-making areas using Power BI.

# Dataset Used:
- Sample : Superstore.csv
- Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacopoferretti/superstore-dataset
- (Standard sales dataset with Region, Category, Segment, Sales, Profit, Order/Ship Dates, etc.)

# Data Cleaning Performed:
Before building visualizations, the following cleaning steps were performed in Power BI:
- Converted Order Date and Ship Date columns to correct Date format
- Fixed column errors caused by invalid date values
- Verified for null or missing values across columns
- Ensured correct data types for all key fields


# Visuals Created:
1. Sales vs Profit by Sub-Category
→ Shows product categories like Tables and Bookcases that make losses despite high sales.
2. Cards
→ Total Sales, Total Profit, and Count of Loss-Making Sub-Categories
3. Profit by State (Filled Map)
→ Geographic view highlighting states like Texas and Pennsylvania with consistent losses.
4. Sales vs Profit by Product (Scatter Plot)
→ Focused view on products with high sales but deep negative profits.
5. Region × Segment Heatmap (Matrix)
→ Insight into which segments underperform in which regions. (e.g., South - Corporate)
6. Insight Summary Text Box
→ Added a final slide with business conclusions using text boxes and clean layout.


# Deliverables
